# Redux Eshop

I created a book store ecommerce with Redux, as I needed to train my brain to understand Redux more eloquently.

## The website could be separated into these parts:

- Home page - all books displayed, user can add them to the basket
- Book page - selected book with description, adding option also provided
- Basket - user sees all added books, their price, increasing or decreasing quantity or removing book is possible
- Checkout - user submits delivery information

## Tech stack (libraries) used:

- React JS
- Redux
- Lodash
- React Router DOM
- React Icons

## My challenges:

- writing reducers
- responsive design for various screen sizes and phones
